add text to speech so that if that is the first time you run the program.. it welcomes you... and if you go to the home screen for the nth time (n != 1), then it would say welcome back or something like that but not the same sentence everytime.. we can add sizzling sounds and everytime a different and not a voice which repeats each time.. we can also use the powershell tts function to make the program speak what we want instead of adding audios ourselves.. we can also make the color random for all the screens which would also be interesting.. we can also a function to search the food by categories ...
